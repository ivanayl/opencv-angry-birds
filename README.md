Project Description: 
      A small scale recreation of the game Angry Birds, incorporating the physics of projectiles (birds) and collisions.
      The player uses the mouse to angle the projectile.
      The goal is to collide the birds with the pig and wood/metal objects and decrease their health with winning
      meaning that all the pigs in the level have been killed using the limited number of birds provided. If there are
      still pigs alive when the birds run out, the player loses.
       
How to Run: Run cs-project.py. Make sure opencv is installed. Use a brightly red colored object for the controller if
      using the opencv feature and use in a well lit setting for best detection.
